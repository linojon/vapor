I have a table for Users and their favorite colors are listed in Colors. The Users has a color_id column to link it. Currently it will just display the value of color_id.

1. The grid appears on the page
2. The pager has the correct information in it: I return 49 records and the pager indicates that it is page 1 of 5. If I change the rows/page, the pager changes the total number of pages.
BUT
3. The rhs of the pager says 'No records to view'.
4. Using Firebug I can see my data returned as XML in the Response.

It seems that the EAV model is something people are getting more interested in lately as flexible databases are being needed for all the crazy semantic web stuff people want.

It turns out that it's possible to write an efficient EAV system --  the problem seems to be that everyone was trying to do it using RDBMSes, which happen to have a really complex pipeline for every query (due to all the locking and transactions and query optimization and other misc things). An EAV store can do with a much, much simpler data access pipeline. :) 

Daniel Abadi (http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/) has totally dug into the current 30-year old RDBMS technology and figured out some really interesting things. This paper is awesome -- http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/papers/oltpperf-sigmod08.pdf. He shows that 95% of the work that an OLTP database does is wasted (locking/latching/logging/buffer-management), and if you remove all that stuff, and deal with the concurrency and consistency and problems by making the database single-threaded and replicated, you get a ridiculous boost in performance. :)

Here's a great diagram: http://epi.ponzo.net/images/OLTP_overhead.png

Another interesting development is the Freebase.com database called ""graphd"" (http://blog.freebase.com/2008/04/09/a-brief-tour-of-graphd/). It's got good performance (freebase is freakin huge), and the way you query it is neat -- instead of asking for rows, you pass it a (possibly-nested) hash of attribute=>value pairs. If the value is filled in, it finds that, and if a value is nil, that's one of the fields in your result. You basically leave out pieces, and it fills them in. :D

You can see this in action by playing with their query editor: http://www.freebase.com/tools/queryeditor (a nice set of example queries are at the bottom.)

I can see people moving to databases that are similar to what CouchDB et al. are doing -- you store all your data in a homogenous form, but have ""views"" of the data which are kinda like dynamic schema, and generate index structures for performance.",2,epitron,2,0

David, thanks for the new syntax. As I stated before these are old specs written as of RSpec 0.7.x/0.8.x hence the need for this monkey patching of Spec::Rails::EvalContext. If I recall correctly there were no other way of doing that at that time. ",2,"Jonathan Tron",2,0

The Sessions controller should login with cookie - just refuses to work, if I change any of the specs, then it breaks more of them. I have read through the code several times and I can't see any reason for it failing. Please let me know if you have any idea how I can fix this.

This was caused by the fact that I move all the protected methods in the sessions controller spec to the spec_helper.rb. Doing so rendered the cookie_for method unable to create a cookie as that method depends on the presence of the users fixture. Now I pass the object User to the method instead of the symbol.

@Andy, sorry I was wrong. My error stemmed from the fact that the sessions controller action new place no call to the current_user method in AuthenticatedSystem.

I spend all this time specifying on my *controller* the types of user who are permitted to access a resource, and then over in the view I have to say the same thing all over again.

I am thinking it would make more sense to make a conditional link_to which determines which controller and action will be called, then asks that controller if the action is accessible, and only shows the link if it is.  A lot of these authorisation systems do have enough state information to be able to do this, so it's astonishing that nobody has completed the last part of the exercise.

the agile rails book is out of date, the scaffolding commands in the first few chapters completely fail and dont even have a decent work around, you just have to skip that section, except the whole book builds on it.   Rails doesn't remain backward compatible with itself from version to version, and so many tutorials are out of date or don't even work anymore.

Also, most rails tutorials are built around magic, so if you need to do anything more than what the tutorial shows, you are up a creek without a paddle because moving from magic to solid ground is difficult.

The django docs are easier to traverse after you have read them. When you go back to repeat on another project, it is easy to find the  meat in the django docs, they are just laid out better and separate the discussion from the action so it is easy to find the parts that you need later.  They do a better job of hitting related topics all at once rather than sprinkling them all over the book so you never find them once you have read them the first time.

Both do a good job of explaining with real world examples.

I'd give 100 books that suck for one that is worth reading.  Quantity of ""documentation"" is irrelevant, if not an actual hindrance.

I think flawed security is much better than no security. Therefore there is not much excuse for them not having a better security. I think the real problem in django is that there is no framework for registering views. In admin there is a framework for registering models and modeladmins, but there is no easy way to get a list of view functions. Until this list can be got hold of, there is no easy way of controlling user's access to views. <br />
 
<p>Another approach, is restricting user access to object attributes on blocked/readonly/editable basis and there is also no support for this in django yet. This is coarse grained but works for most situations and is very easy to audit. <p/>

Another point is ad hoc control - like authors only being able to edit their own comments. This could easily be solved by building sets of conditional methods and passing them unbound to decorators, or better still, make views classes (which they should be) and put them in as lists of checks as class attributes.",2,Mike,2,0

98,Rails_and_Django_-_Templates%2C_Forms_%28part_8%2F15%29,"Rails and Django - Templates, Forms (part 8/15)",1231698938,"Django's template system looks nice but, frankly, overdoes it to the point where you can almost guarantee maintenance and usability issues down the line. 

Case in point - look at the numerous built in template tags. ""Great"", you might think, ""there are all these tags that let me do all this stuff. I can put all the display logic in the template."" 

Wrong. 

What happens is beginners get lulled into trying that, and sure it works great for a few forms or simple pages. But as soon as they need to do anything remotely hard, they simply get stuck, cos the template system just isn't up to much. Then they might try implementing their own template tag libraries, and before you know it, they have embarked on writing their own sucky programming language inside the template system. They would be much better off with PHP. In fact I wonder if some of the django developers who left this stuff in have PHPness-envy.

Just ask yourself - {% ifequal %}... {% ifnotequal %}? 
WTF??

{% includes %} in django templates are also deadly. They create highly coupled and fragile designs. Why couple your view code to just one template when you can couple it to two? Even better when you can add in your own crazy template tag scheme to make up for shortcomings in what django's own.

It's so confused because the display logic is forced to live in 2 places - inside the view, and also inside the template. No attempt is made to clarify how the display logic should be divided up. Model Template View and claiming that the definition of MVC is debatable just doesn't cut it these days. (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/)

The attribute lookup rubbish with {{ x.y.z }} is also deadly in much the same way. It creates fragile designs by ignoring the most fundamental aspect of OOP - encapsulation. Sure, lets rip attributes off stuff at will. Oops we get the schema a bit wrong... guess we'll just have to rewrite those 50 templates we made last months...

In short - django would have been far better off leaving all this stuff out and going for a proper OO approach, and being clear about what renders what. Templates should be simple, simple enough for a designer to understand and simple enough that they can't also break things - allowing attribute lookup potentially puts *everything* at the whim of the template. Yup, this means the security nightmare where a designer gets a shot at screwing up your database by using the wrong attribute. We were wondering why the team members seemed to multiply each time we looked at the team list page. It was because someone had used the wrong method as an attribute, and it was re-saving the members on each request. 

As for newforms - what a mess! Try this: run a find in django/forms/models.py for ""inlineformset_factory"" (django v1.0). Once you understand what it is doing, you will agree there can be few more convoluted ways of doing what is really not a very complex task. 3 levels of factories for one class? Building the exact same ModelForm classes over and over again on *each and every* request? Having 2 separate classes generate the queryset? Functions taking 15 arguments? django's newforms is textbook bad OO design, python or no python.

And please, don't tell me to rewrite it. I was already forced to rewrite a lot of the core code, before our client pulled the plug on our django-powered site entirely, and before we all lost our jobs. Hopefully I will get some time to offer it up to the django gods soon.

I have friends who are ruby people and they say ruby is great and I am sure it is. I use python every day, and my friends seem to treat me as the python geek for language wars.

Regarding performance; with psyco, django is wonderfully quick.


The big problem I have with python is the lack of encapsulation support. This is especially a problem with django's template system where template designers can get their dirty hands on your object's private parts. One way is to prefix with an underscore, but it seems clumsy and hacky and leaves your code none the prettier. All in all, without encapsulation, python can't call itself a real OO language, but it doesn't do badly.



The other big problem, and related to this, is isinstance().



Type sniffing with isinstance is, I would say, not a crime but a tragic and filthy habit worse than using switch statements. Few things wreck flexibility more.


 
So, want to know how well written django really is? grep a django checkout for ""isinstance"". Last time I checked there were over 600 usages! Now consider that  in python 2.1.1 there were only 68 usages, mostly in test code testing that it worked... you get the picture. Here's more info:

http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/


So we can see, django has a *serious* addiction to sniffing types. Sure it gives it that 'quick fix' to get it through the releases but one day it will wake up, look in the mirror and realise it badly needs a few months at the refactoring spa.

secondly, to solve the problem of the refresh, would adding an extra holding var and an additional url check not solve the issue?

I mean, if you are taking the previous url... passing it to ""second previous URL"".  As this is done, check to see if CurrentURL = PreviousURL etc... this means that you can tell it to ignore the change, and keep the prior url ???",2,Autocrat,2,0

This all works great: the user can upload files, and I can display the file contents later (either images or audio).

The problem I'm running into is that when the article is deleted, or the user checks the ""clear"" checkbox for the upload... the file never actually gets deleted!  The uploaded file is properly no longer associated with the article, but the actual file is still there and shows up in my list of uploaded files.

It's similar to this message in the xaraya forum (that no one answered): http://www.xaraya.com/index.php/xarbb/topic/2541

I came across your Article on the Xaraya Rating Module when I was searching for information on the Xaraya site. I know this is an old post, so I hope you don't mind me posing questions here, as I would like to use the Rating Module and I need clarification on a couple of things.

My initial aim is to use it to Rate against one Publication Type only. But, if I want to extend that to other PubTypes further down the line and to gather data for one or more Top Items Blocks, would I need to use the trick you mention and hook the Ratings Module to all Article PubTypes, then prevent the display of Ratings in the ones not using it? If that's the case, how do I prevent Ratings displaying in the non-ratings PubTypes?

Then the other thing I wasn't clear about is what is displayed on the page. The code snippets you include mention one being placed at the top and the other at the base of the template. Is that an either/or scenario? And as per my first question, the default ""Hooks"" code in a template seems to display all Hooks, so how do you prevent just the Ratings Module output from displaying.

I guess I have a lot more to learn about Xaraya, but I'm a bit confused in particular on these points.

Oh, one final question. Are the ratings displayed (stars) just for that person for that specific session (day)? Is it the totals that are being recorded that are being displayed in the Top Items Block?

Again, I hope you don't mind me posting these questions here.

Cheers,

I didn't notice the ""<xar:continue />"" when I first looked at the code. And I also figured out what I must do to selectively display the ratings in other display templates. I guess I wasn't thinking clearly when I posed my previous questions. However, with the top display code added, I do get the following error in the Articles Admin only when I attempt edit an Article:

The proper fix to get better error messages is:

1. Open file html/includes/exceptions/systemexception.class.php

2. Find line 20 or 21 that reads:
